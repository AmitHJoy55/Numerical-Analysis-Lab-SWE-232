  <p>#Task_101
Complete the following tasks of matrix manipulation:
Define two matrices A & B. The values of these matrices will be taken as input from the command-line
Print the max value from matrix A
Multiply matrix A & B. Handle the case where multiplication is impossible (print proper message/resulting matrix).
#Task_102
Implement root finding Bisection method.
Store the root of each iteration in a matrix.
Plot the equation with the root matrix to achieve a graphical view of finding roots.
Task_103
Implement root finding False-position method.
Store the root of each iteration in a matrix.
Plot the equation with the root matrix to achieve a graphical view of finding roots.
#Task_104
Implement root finding Newton-raphson method.
Store the root of each iteration in a matrix.
Plot the equation with the root matrix to achieve a graphical view of finding roots.
Bonus(+5): Draw the tangent/slope line you found at each iteration.
#Code and resources for the Numerical Analysis Lab are available in this repository. These include matrix manipulation and the three root-finding techniques, Newton-Raphson, Bisection, and False Position.
